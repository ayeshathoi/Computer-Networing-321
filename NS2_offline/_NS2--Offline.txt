Submission Deadline: January 30, 2023, Monday, 11:59 PM


Personalised Parameters: 
802.11	AODV	TCP Tahoe + Telnet	Random	1 Source, Random Sink

Wireless MAC Type:
* Wireless 802.15.4 
* Wireless 802.11


Routing Protocol:
* DSDV
* AODV
* DSR


Agent + Application:
* UDP + Exponential Traffic
* UDP + CBR Traffic
* TCP Reno + FTP 
* TCP Tahoe + Telnet, 


Node Positioning:
* Random (Randomly place nodes anywhere with area)
* Grid (Place nodes in a grid. You can choose the number of rows and columns yourself)


Flow:
* Random Source Destination (For each flow, choose a random source and a destination. Careful not to choose same node as source and destination)
* 1 Source, Random Sink (except source itself) (Choose a random source X, then for each flow choose X as source, and any other node as destination)
* 1 Sink, Random Source (Choose a random sink X, then for each flow choose X as destination, and any other node as source)


________________


Parameters:
Queue: Droptail, max size 50 (Using Queue/DropTail/PriQueue with DSR may cause segmentation fault. In that case you can use CMUPriQueue instead.)
Antenna: Omni Directional
Speed of nodes: Uniform random between 1m/s and 5m/s for each node.
Propagation Model: Two Ray Ground Propagation Model


With your personalised parameters and global parameters fixed, vary the parameters below.




Baseline Parameters: (while varying one parameter, keep other parameters fixed like below)
* Area Size: 500m x 500m 
* Number of Nodes: 40
* Number of flows: 20




Vary parameters:
* Area Size: 250m x 250m, 500m x 500m, 750m x 750m, 1000m x 1000m, 1250m x 1250m
* Number of Nodes: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100
* Number of flows: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50


Metrics:
For each of the varying parameters, plot 4 graph showing,
* Network throughput
* End-to-end delay
* Packet delivery ratio (total # of packets delivered to end destination / total # of packets sent)
* Packet drop ratio (total # of packets dropped / total # of packets sent)


________________


For example: 
Say, for varying area sizes, keep other params fixed as mentioned in baseline. Find 4 metrics for each of the values of area size. Plot each metric in a separate graph. You will get 4 graphs for varying area size. One of them is the Delivery ratio. It may look like this. Clearly mention the x-axis, y-axis, x-ticks and y-ticks.
 Points scored 

The total number of graphs will be 3 x 4 = 12.




Report:
* Write short descriptions of your MAC type, Routing protocol, Agent Type, Application.
* Include all the 12 graphs.
* Write short observations on the results you got.






Submission:
* Code (exclude the trace files, nam files). Include only the source files (.tcl, .sh, .awk, .py, .ipynb or others)
* Report as pdf.
* Put all of these in a zip file
* Name it as your student id (1805xxx.zip)
* Submit
